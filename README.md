# 📚 Library Management Software with Python (Tkinter + SQLite)

This is a simple desktop application for managing a small library system, built using Python. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter, and uses SQLite3 for local data storage. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and search for books through a user-friendly interface.

# ✨ Key Features

● Add new books with details such as title, author, subject, and publication year

● Update book information by providing the book’s ID

● Delete books from the database using their unique ID

● Search and view book information by entering the book ID

● Clean and intuitive GUI for ease of use

# 💡 Technologies Used

● Python 3 – main programming language

● Tkinter – for building the graphical user interface

● SQLite3 – for local database storage

# 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the project folder.

3. Run the main Python file to launch the application.

4. Use the buttons and forms to manage books in the library.

# 📌 Notes

● All data is saved locally using SQLite and remains available even after the app is closed.

● This project is designed for learning purposes and can be expanded into a more complete system.

● Possible future features include user accounts, book lending/return system, and reporting tools.
